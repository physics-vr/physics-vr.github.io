                       &emsp;This week we narrowed down our vision to developing a 3D Electric Field Visualizer and an app&nbsp;
                       that will use the visualizer and allow users to interact with kinematic charges in a playground&nbsp;
                       environment.  We have built a new scene and modified code provided by Jared Canright (Physics Not&nbsp;
                       Included) to create the base scene and playground, created the 3D Electric Field, and scripted &nbsp;
                       animations showing the 3D electric vector field responding to charges in real-time.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Current goals for next week</h4>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Handle User Interaction through controller events in scene</li>
                    <li>Be able to add and move charges, reset scene, delete charges</li>
                    <li>Improve vector visuals further, include research on getting alpha/opacity to work for our vectors</li>
                    <li>Record an animated charge going through electric field for class presentation</li>
                    <li>Research a simple curated demo a user might experience for after playground is further along</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Work Completed this week</h4>
                    <p>
                      &emsp;Ryan - I had meetings with Jared and had some back and forth with Aditya on our final concept.  After&nbsp;
                      arriving at the Electric Field Visualizer concept, I updated the PRD with a more concrete outlook on&nbsp;
                      the MVP and potential stretch goals.  On the project side, I worked on a new unity scene that will be&nbsp;
                      the basis for our playground.  The work on the scene this week included adding 3D grid version of Jared's&nbsp;
                      plane probe that works for 3 dimensions, adding the 3D vector field, a game floor with player teleport&nbsp;
                      , and coloring and sizing vectors by magnitude returned from Jared's EM engine.</br></br>&emsp;This coming week&nbsp;
                      I will be working on videos for Tuesday's presentation then will be working on controller input to add&nbsp;
                      charges and change scene options.

                    <p>
                       This week out team met with Jared Canright and Suzanne White Bramhia.  We have decided to&nbsp; 
                       work towards a statics demo for the honors Electromagnetism honors 122 class in winter.&nbsp; 
                       Jared has a working EM demo with magentic field vectors visualized on negative and positive&nbsp; 
                       charges which the user can place and move. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                       Our team will be assisting Jared build out features for his project: Physics Not Included, and&nbsp; 
                       will be working the project into a Statics demo for next quarter.  This week we will be&nbsp;
                       beginning to work with Physics Not Included.  Since this was built for Oculus and Vive&nbsp; 
                       controllers, we will first need to figure out building and controller event handling&nbsp; 
                       across these two platforms.  We worked Thursday with Jared to build a couple of working&nbsp;
                       scense using WMR and our controllers.&nbsp;
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Current goals from Jared:</h4>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Improved UI/UX with RayCasting</li>
                    <li>Networking Capability, multidevices in a single scene</li>
                    <li>Unit Testing to confirm physics calculations</li>
                    <li>Allow Session Recording</li>
                    <li>Build in TA Interaction</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Work Completed this week</h4>
                    <p>
                      Ryan - I worked on learning controller input in Unity through Unity.Input API, and am currently&nbsp;
                      using that in the Gravitational Potential Energy Demo to setup, reset, and play the demo.  I was&nbsp; 
                      in attendance for the meeting with Jared and Suzanne to discuss potential useful demos and got&nbsp; 
                      to demo Jared's current work on the Oculus.  Also worked on the blog and updated the PRD to&nbsp; 
                      reflect current progress and outlook.  This week I will be investigating networking with VR&nbsp;
                      VR Applications, playing with RayCasting, and working with building Jared's project and&nbsp;
                      accepting input with the WMR and Motion Controllers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Jeff - I worked on familiarizing with different Unity APIs. I attended to the meeting with Jared&nbsp;
                      and Suzanne to discuss the vision for Jared’s work and potential work we can do. I look into Jared’s&nbsp;
                      current code and understand the code he wrote and EM package he used. I will look for RayCasting solution&nbsp;
                      for controllers and also better field representations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Candice - I worked on familiaring myself with Unity scripting. I looked more into controller input&nbsp;
                      I spent time looking for solutions on the location mismatch of the controllers. I was in attendace&nbsp;
                      for the meeting with Jared and Suzanne to discuss potential useful demos. I started to look into the existing&nbsp;
                      code base from Jared's github. I participated in the group discussion on where the project could be readed to.&nbsp;
                      This week I will continue looking into Jared's code base and look into how to create our own scenue utilizing&nbsp;
                      some of the tools Jared has implemented.

                    <p>This week we created a basic demo revolving around gravitational potential energy and conversion to kinetic energy.  The user is placed in a room with a switch, hovering a hand on the switch activates a falling block demo paired with a real-time text display updating vertical velocity, gravitational potential energy, and vertical kinetic energy.  The user can reset the demo and rewatch.  Although this basic demo is mechanics related and we are going to be moving forward with working with the physics department on a EM demo, we learned valuable skills in Unity, C#, and using the SteamVR api's.</p>
                    <p>These skills include event handling from a SteamVR Interactable object, working with Unity's built in Physics engine and Rigidbody classes, working with and updating UiText objects in Unity, and basic C# scripting to manipulate GameObjects and handle Unity Events.</p>
                    <p>Aditya facilitated a meeting with the Physics Education Group at the University of Washington this week, and we have shifted our focus from creating high school education materials to creating materials to integrate into their electrodynamics tutorial program. We are excited to be collaborating with a group who has such deep domain expertise.</p>
