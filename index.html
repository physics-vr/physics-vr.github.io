                       &emsp;
                       Since last update we have focused on adding user functionality and improving user experience.&nbsp;
                       Charges now scale with intensity of charge and have different colors for polarity.  We have&nbsp;
                       added a distance interaction tool that greatly improves the users ability to interact with&nbsp;
                       the scene.  The tool is active when the left trigger is held and allows the user to move&nbsp;
                       charges in the distance around the scene, allows moving charges away or toward the user,&nbsp;
                       and also allows the deleting of charges.  This significantly improves the users ability&nbsp;
                       to use the entire scene area and also see real time effects of moving charges in space&nbsp;
                       </br></br>&emsp;
                       This week we will focus on improving visualization and fixing any repeatable bugs.&nbsp;
                       We plan to work more with styling the vectors to make the scene more consistent and&nbsp;
                       less cluttered.  We also will be adding a feature to the distance interaction tool that&nbsp;
                       will allow the user to view an electric field line from a point on a charge they point to.&nbsp;
                       A stretch goal will be to add subtle animation to the field line and vectors to improve&nbsp;
                       the feeling of direction.

                    <h4>Current goals for next week</h4>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Improve vector visuals</li>
                    <li>Find and fix repeatable bugs</li>

                    </ul>

                    <h4>Work Completed</h4>
                    <p>
                    <strong>Ryan</strong> - I added changing color support to the charge prefabs to denote polarity with color,&nbsp; 
                      and a feature to scale charges with charge level.  I also designed and implemented a laser pointer&nbsp;
                      that I needed for RayCasting interaction with the charges.  I then used this to build a new user tool,&nbsp;
                      Distance Interaction Tool.  When active (Active with a user holding left trigger) the user can point&nbsp;
                      a laser at charges in the scene to interact with the charges.  This allows moving the charges in 3D,&nbsp;
                      moving the charges towards and away from user position, and deleting charges from the scene.
                      </br></br>
                      On the administrative side, I recorded a video highlighting the interaction update, drafted the demo&nbsp;
                      plan, and wrote this post.
                    </p>
                    </br>
                    <p>
                    <strong>Candice</strong> - I worked more on the vector visualization. I further looked into the vector size&nbsp;
                    and after discussing it with the rest of the group, I rescaled the vectors and made the bigger ones skinnier&nbsp;
                    so that it looks better and the scene would be eaiser to see through. I also worked and am still working on&nbsp;
                    the tutorial part where it shows the control on the controller. I am making an image to illustrate the use&nbsp;
                    of the controller. I also spent time brainstorming a better way to show all of the button controls since we&nbsp;
                    have two different modes in the scene, and in each modes, buttons could serve different functionalities. So&nbsp;
                    I thought of using different colors to illustrate different functions under different modes.

                    <p>
                       &emsp;Last week we narrowed down our vision to developing a 3D Electric Field Visualizer and an app&nbsp;
                       that will use the visualizer and allow users to interact with kinematic charges in a playground&nbsp;
                       environment.  We have built a new scene and modified code provided by Jared Canright (Physics Not&nbsp;
                       Included) to create the base scene and playground, created the 3D Electric Field, and scripted &nbsp;
                       animations showing the 3D electric vector field responding to charges in real-time.
                       </br></br>
                       &emsp;This week we recorded a demo scene of our app, presented our work to the class, and extended&nbsp;
                       our in app control system.  The player can now add charges to the scene, adjust the charge level&nbsp;
                       of the next charge, and reset the charges of the scene.  Additionally, backend work was done to&nbsp;
                       hold on to the game state and design the control flow for what we will build next week.</br>

                      &emsp;Ryan - Last week had meetings with Jared and had some back and forth with Aditya on our final concept.  After&nbsp;
                      arriving at the Electric Field Visualizer concept, I updated the PRD with a more concrete outlook on&nbsp;
                      the MVP and potential stretch goals.  On the project side, I worked on a new unity scene that will be&nbsp;
                      the basis for our playground.  The work on the scene this week included adding 3D grid version of Jared's&nbsp;
                      plane probe that works for 3 dimensions, adding the 3D vector field, a game floor with player teleport&nbsp;
                      , and coloring and sizing vectors by magnitude returned from Jared's EM engine.</br>&emsp;
                      This week I worked on capturing video of our demos, and worked on slides related the demos, inspiration&nbsp;
                      , and history.  On the project side I worked on the&nbsp;
                      controller scripts and game state.  This allows us to have a defined game state that is updated by&nbsp;
                      game events, and allows the user to perform actions in the scene.  The actions are adjusting the&nbsp;
                      charge value of the next placed charge, adding a charge to the scene, and wiping the charges from&nbsp;
                      the scene
                      </br>&emsp;
                      Next week I will be working on more user interaction, visual cues for charge value differences, and&nbsp;
                      start work on the information tool.  I got some great feedback during Thursday's demo that will be&nbsp;
                      helpful to make the user experience more friendly.  During information tool work, I will also experiment&nbsp; 
                      with field line or particle animation to try to better illustrate the flow of the field.

                    <p>
                      Candice - I worked on visualization of the project. I spent a lot of times working on the visualization&nbsp;
                      of the vectors. We first had a discussion around which of the three, size, color, oppacity, should be changed&nbsp;
                      according to the magnitude of the vectors. We then tried to figure out oppacity and realized the constraints on&nbsp;
                      such. So I spent a lot time working on figuring out a better formula for size and coloring. At the end I failed to&nbsp;
                      perfectly scaling it but was slowing improving it. I utilized the strategy to rescale the actual difference between&nbsp;
                      the max and min size and then shift each by a fixed number.

                       This week out team met with Jared Canright and Suzanne White Bramhia.  We have decided to&nbsp; 
                       work towards a statics demo for the honors Electromagnetism honors 122 class in winter.&nbsp; 
                       Jared has a working EM demo with magentic field vectors visualized on negative and positive&nbsp; 
                       charges which the user can place and move. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                       Our team will be assisting Jared build out features for his project: Physics Not Included, and&nbsp; 
                       will be working the project into a Statics demo for next quarter.  This week we will be&nbsp;
                       beginning to work with Physics Not Included.  Since this was built for Oculus and Vive&nbsp; 
                       controllers, we will first need to figure out building and controller event handling&nbsp; 
                       across these two platforms.  We worked Thursday with Jared to build a couple of working&nbsp;
                       scense using WMR and our controllers.&nbsp;
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Current goals from Jared:</h4>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Improved UI/UX with RayCasting</li>
                    <li>Networking Capability, multidevices in a single scene</li>
                    <li>Unit Testing to confirm physics calculations</li>
                    <li>Allow Session Recording</li>
                    <li>Build in TA Interaction</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                      Ryan - I worked on learning controller input in Unity through Unity.Input API, and am currently&nbsp;
                      using that in the Gravitational Potential Energy Demo to setup, reset, and play the demo.  I was&nbsp; 
                      in attendance for the meeting with Jared and Suzanne to discuss potential useful demos and got&nbsp; 
                      to demo Jared's current work on the Oculus.  Also worked on the blog and updated the PRD to&nbsp; 
                      reflect current progress and outlook.  This week I will be investigating networking with VR&nbsp;
                      VR Applications, playing with RayCasting, and working with building Jared's project and&nbsp;
                      accepting input with the WMR and Motion Controllers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Jeff - I worked on familiarizing with different Unity APIs. I attended to the meeting with Jared&nbsp;
                      and Suzanne to discuss the vision for Jared’s work and potential work we can do. I look into Jared’s&nbsp;
                      current code and understand the code he wrote and EM package he used. I will look for RayCasting solution&nbsp;
                      for controllers and also better field representations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Candice - I worked on familiaring myself with Unity scripting. I looked more into controller input&nbsp;
                      I spent time looking for solutions on the location mismatch of the controllers. I was in attendace&nbsp;
                      for the meeting with Jared and Suzanne to discuss potential useful demos. I started to look into the existing&nbsp;
                      code base from Jared's github. I participated in the group discussion on where the project could be readed to.&nbsp;
                      This week I will continue looking into Jared's code base and look into how to create our own scenue utilizing&nbsp;
                      some of the tools Jared has implemented.

                    <p>This week we created a basic demo revolving around gravitational potential energy and conversion to kinetic energy.  The user is placed in a room with a switch, hovering a hand on the switch activates a falling block demo paired with a real-time text display updating vertical velocity, gravitational potential energy, and vertical kinetic energy.  The user can reset the demo and rewatch.  Although this basic demo is mechanics related and we are going to be moving forward with working with the physics department on a EM demo, we learned valuable skills in Unity, C#, and using the SteamVR api's.</p>
                    <p>These skills include event handling from a SteamVR Interactable object, working with Unity's built in Physics engine and Rigidbody classes, working with and updating UiText objects in Unity, and basic C# scripting to manipulate GameObjects and handle Unity Events.</p>
                    <p>Aditya facilitated a meeting with the Physics Education Group at the University of Washington this week, and we have shifted our focus from creating high school education materials to creating materials to integrate into their electrodynamics tutorial program. We are excited to be collaborating with a group who has such deep domain expertise.</p>
